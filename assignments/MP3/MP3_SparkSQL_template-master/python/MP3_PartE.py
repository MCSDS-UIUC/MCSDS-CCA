# 1. Setup (10 points): Download the gbook file and write a function to load it in an RDD & DataFrame
####

# RDD API
# Columns:
# 0: place (string), 1: count1 (int), 2: count2 (int), 3: count3 (int)


# Spark SQL - DataFrame API


####
# 5. Joining (10 points): The following program construct a new dataframe out of 'df' with a much smaller size.
####

df2 = df.select("word", "count1").distinct().limit(1000);
df2.createOrReplaceTempView('gbooks2')

# Now we are going to perform a JOIN operation on 'df2'. Do a self-join on 'df2' in lines with the same #'count1' values and see how many lines this JOIN could produce. Answer this question via DataFrame API and #Spark SQL API
# Dataframe API

# output: 9658
